# face_detection

A study on custom paining in flutter

Object boxes were obtained using facenet-pytorch, check out [a sample code](https://github.com/danhojin/ml-notes/blob/master/dl/facenet_pytorch1.ipynb).

see [Custom paining in Flutter - Flutter in Focues](https://youtu.be/vvI_NUXK00s) for further explanation on the flutter widgets which I used.
